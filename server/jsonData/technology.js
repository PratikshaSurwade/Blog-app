    "decription": "The Indian Space & Research Organisation (Isro) wants to conquer Venus after successfully launching missions to the Moon and Mars. Isro chairman S Somnath has said that the space agency has the ability to both build and launch the vehicle in a very short time. However, it's the uniqueness of the mission that will define it.The Venus mission is the next big ticket mission Isro is undertaking along side Chandrayaan-3 and Gaganyaan missions.The orbiter is the third mission announced to the inferno world of Venus after Nasa announced two probes followed by a spacecraft by the European Space Agency. The probes will investigate the world looking for clues to understand the destructive past of Earth's mysterious twin, which scientists believe once had vast reserves of water similar to our planet.Isro conducted a day-long meeting to identify the areas which can be explored when the mission is launched in the coming years. ISRO Chairman S Somnath said the Venus mission has been conceived, project report has been made and money has been identified and urged scientists to focus on high impact outcomes.According to a presentation by scientists, the Venus orbiter will investigate the surface processes as it tries to understand the geologic and resurfacing history of the planet, understand the impact processes and detect buried impact craters on the surface. The probe will aim to create a topography of the surface along with studying the structure, composition, and dynamics of the atmosphere.According to a presentation by scientists, the Venus orbiter will investigate the surface processes as it tries to understand the geologic and resurfacing history of the planet, understand the impact processes and detect buried impact craters on the surface. The probe will aim to create a topography of the surface along with studying the structure, composition, and dynamics of the atmosphere.The space agency is eyeing the December 2024 window for launch with orbital maneuvers planned for the following year when earth and Venus would be so aligned that the spacecraft could be put in the neighbouring planet's orbit using a minimum amount of propellant. The next similar window would be available in 2031",

The partial solar eclipse was seen in several parts of the world, which appeared as if someone had taken a bite out of the Sun.An eclipse is a phenomenon when an object comes in between two big objects casting its shadow. In terms of the solar eclipse, this celestial event happens when the moon passes between Earth and the sun.The April 30 event saw the Moon blocking the sunlight coming towards Earth, creating a giant shadow in the process. The celestial event, while visible in the skies over Chile, Argentina, most of Uruguay, western Paraguay, southwestern Bolivia, southeastern Peru, and a small area of southwestern Brazil, was not seen in India.People can now see a glimpse of the event as captured by the Solar Ultraviolet Imager onboard the NOAA's GOES-16 satellite, which caught a glimpse of the Moon's disk as it passed in front of the Sun. This partial solar #eclipse was only visible across the Southern Hemisphere, the agency said in a tweet.",

Users in India can no longer use their credit or debit cards to make payments for services or purchases on the App Store. Why? It is because of the new Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines for auto-debit payments which were announced last year.For the uninitiated, the RBI announced the new auto-debit payment guidelines last year, which require banks to send a pre-debit notification 24 hours before the automatic payment is being processed. This is required for each transaction every month. Recurring payments above Rs 5,000 can only be done with OTP before the debit. Most banks and online services have failed to adhere to the new guidelines. This not only impacted customers but also businesses.",
