    "decription": "Underlining the “shared values of freedom and democracy and rules-based order” with Nordic countries, Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed the situation in Ukraine with the Prime Ministers of Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Iceland at the second India-Nordic summit in Copenhagen Wednesday.With the countries prioritising cooperation in the post-Covid situation, Modi highlighted “how India has used IT platforms for effective outreach and monitoring of Covid vaccination in India”. Stressing on the need for a “human-centric multilateral order”, he told the Nordic leaders that it is India’s belief that “such platforms are natural global good”.After the summit, Modi, in a Twitter post, said, “The India-Nordic Summit will go a long way in boosting India’s ties with the region. Together, there is much that our nations can achieve and contribute to global prosperity and sustainable development.”In Copenhagen, Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra, briefing reporters on the India-Nordic summit, said, “The leaders did exchange views on matters of regional and global interest, that naturally included Ukraine also.” He said the issue of Indo-Pacific too was discussed at the meeting. These came up in the summit and bilateral meetings.“Nordic countries and India have shared values of freedom and democracy and rules-based order and also share perspectives on various political matters,” he said.",

    "decription": "THE CIVIL Registration System (CRS) data for 2020 includes a key metric that shows how difficult it was for people to access health facilities during the pandemic: over 45 per cent of all recorded deaths that year happened in the absence of medical attention, the highest percentage ever.The data also show a sharp decline in deaths recorded in hospitals and other medical facilities in 2020For several months in 2020, when the pandemic first gripped the world, non-Covid medical services were suspended or operating thinly inIndia, with 80 to 100 per cent of beds in several hospitals reserved for Covid patients. As a result, a large number of people were unable to receive medical care for non-Covid illnesses.The CRS data has captured this agony for the first time.The proportion of people dying in the absence of medical attention increased from 34.5 per cent of all recorded deaths in 2019 to 45 per cent in 2020, the largest single-year jump.Simultaneously, deaths under institutional care dropped from 32.1 per cent in 2019 to 28 per cent in 2020, the sharpest ever decline.These two data points do not indicate a new or unusual phenomena. The proportion of deaths in the absence of medical attention has been steadily increasing over the past decade, and the proportion of institutional deaths coming down.",

    "decription": "In a setback to the Uddhav Thackeray government in Maharashtra, the Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the State Election Commission to notify election schedule for local bodies within two weeks on the basis of the previous delimitation exercise, rejecting the stand that it can be done only after fresh delimitation is done by the state government.A bench presided by Justice A M Khanwilkar said, “The process of delimitation being a continuous exercise may be continued by the State of Maharashtra, subject to the outcome of these petitions, but that would be relevant only for future elections after such exercise is completed.”The bench said that since the five-year term of around 2,486 local bodies in the state had expired and elections were required to be conducted under provisions of the Constitution as well as the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, the exercise “cannot brook any delay”.“Accordingly, the election programme of such local bodies must proceed and the State Election Commission is obliged to notify the election programme within two weeks from today in respect of such local bodies… on the basis of the delimitation done prior to coming into force of the Amendment Act(s) with effect from 11.03.2022,” said the bench, also comprising Justices Abhay S Oka and C T Ravikumar.",
